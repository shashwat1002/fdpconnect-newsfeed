That would have been an act of patriotism. But by shooting Gandhiji, the world was saddened, and still mourns his assassination [on October 30, 1948],\u201d said Mr. Raut.The Sena leader\u2019s remarks against Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s assassin Nathuram Godse were a thinly veiled swipe at its former saffron ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), whose leaders have openly hailed Godse on occasion.The BJP is in the Opposition in Maharashtra where an ideologically opposed tripartite coalition of the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) led by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray holds power.In a rich irony, Mr. Thackeray\u2019s father \u2013 Sena founder Bal Thackeray \u2013 had infamously lauded Nathuram Godse\u2019s act at an election rally in Pune in 1991 in support of the BJP candidate Anna Joshi when both saffron parties were allies in Maharashtra.Mr. Raut\u2019s remarks reflect the Sena\u2019s affinity towards the Congress and Mr. Gandhi, which has steadily grown post the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in Uttar Pradesh last year.More importantly, ever since the Sena\u2019s alliance with the Congress and the NCP to deprive the BJP of power in Maharashtra, the party\u2019s relationship with \u2018Hindutva\u2019 and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has been markedly ambivalent, with the BJP losing no chance to criticise Mr. Thackeray\u2019s party of having forsaken \u2018Hindutva\u2019s\u2019 ideals.In his weekly column Rokhthok in the Sena\u2019s mouthpiece Saamana, Mr. Raut quashed speculation of an \u201cunder the table deal\u201d for a BJP-Shiv Sena reunion, remarking that the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of Mr.Thackeray was Maharashtra\u2019s \u201cpolitical future\u201d.Mr. Raut, Sena\u2019s chief spokesperson, further took potshots at the BJP by remarking that Mr. Thackeray, in his address to Shiv Sainiks on January 23, had turned the tables on the BJP which had criticised the Maharashtra CM over his illness.Mr. Thackeray, who had undergone a cervical spine surgery a couple of months ago, had lambasted the BJP\u2019s alleged \u201cdouble standards\u201d on \u2018Hindutva\u2019 in his address while detailing how the Sena had \u201crotted\u201d during its alliance with the BJP in the State.\u201cThe message from Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s speech made it clear that the MVA of the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress is the political future of Maharashtra and there is no truth in the speculation that there was an \u2018under the table deal\u2019 happening between the Shiv Sena and BJP,\u201d Mr. Raut said in his column.BJP Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, in a riposte to Mr. Thackeray\u2019s speech, had said the Sena had been able grow politically only when it was in alliance with the BJP.\u201cUddhav Thackeray\u2019s speech and Devendra Fadnavis\u2019s response to it have made the State\u2019s politics clear and there is no room for confusion now\u2026there is no possibility of a Shiv Sena-BJP \u2018reunion\u2019 after Mr. Fadnavis\u2019s response,\u201d said Mr. Raut, who is the executive editor of Saamana. Criticising Mr. Fadnavis, Mr. Raut pointed that senior BJP leaders like Gopinath Munde, Pramod Mahajan or Eknath Khadse had never behaved towards the Sena in a high-handed manner.He further remarked drily that the BJP would have to spend the next several years around the Raj Bhavan, alluding to its approaching the Governor on numerous occasions regarding various issues pertaining to the State.The Shiv Sena\u2019s 25-year-old alliance with the BJP had ended after the parties bickered acrimoniously after the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly polls over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post. Despite the BJP emerging as the single-largest party, the Sena had forged an alliance with the NCP and the Congress to form the government under Mr. Thackeray\u2019s leadership.\n\n\n\nPrintable version | Jan 30, 2022 4:27:31 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a-true-hindutvavadi-would-have-shot-jinnah-and-not-mahatma-gandhi-says-sanjay-raut/article38349078.ece\n\n\u00a9 THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD.\n\nA video analysing the measures taken by EC to conduct Assembly Elections when COVID-19 cases are surging\n\nA video on a village that cultivates various kinds of vegetables all through the year.\n"
