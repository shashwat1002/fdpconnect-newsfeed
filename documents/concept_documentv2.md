# Description 

The project is the part of a whole suite of applications that make the service. The service is an all-round dashboard for users in the import export business. 

The project specifically focuses on collecting news articles that would be relevant to the import export business. The component should also try to rank them in some order of relevance. 

# Profile of Users 

The typical user is the businessperson using the service. 


# Feature highlights

## Get news articles from given sources for a given time-frame 

The project needs to be able to collect news articles in computer-readable format from a given list of news providers if possible. 

Ideally, an established API is used for this. 

Please note that the extent of coverage of scraping is subject to paywalls and other similar factors.

## Sorting data on a relevance basis

The news articles that were collected will need to be sorted on the basis of relevance using a statistical model or an ML model as seen suitable over the course of developement. 

To elaborate on "relevance":

- relevance to the import-export business
- relevance to the countries the user is concerned with. 
- relevance to the product the user is interested in.
